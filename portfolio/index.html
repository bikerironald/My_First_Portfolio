        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Ronald Bikeri, a frontend developer with a strong focus on building responsive, user-friendly web
            interfaces. I specialize in technologies like React, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, and I enjoy
            transforming complex problems into clean, maintainable code. Beyond development, I’m passionate about
            UI/UX design, often exploring new trends and tools to enhance the user experience. When I’m not coding,
            you’ll find me cycling, contributing to side projects, or diving into tech talks and tutorials to keep
            growing both technically and creatively.
